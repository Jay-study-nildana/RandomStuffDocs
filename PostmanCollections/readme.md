# Postman Collections

Ready to use Postman Collections. The file name corresponds to the version number of the project.

Update. As of 0.3.0, I am no longer updating postman collections. It's recommended you use the API server's built in Swagger documentation to do test runs.

Note : If you are reading on the github pages website, you need to see the corresponding github repository page.
