# API Server - Mainly Controllers

This is sort of identical to the API Endpoint (which also has a dedicated API documentation folder and pages). However, here, I want to put more technical details, and talk about code and implementation details. 

There are lot of controllers which are unloaded but still included in the project. This is on purpose.

# Table Of Contents

* [Database](Database.md)
* [Adding New Scopes](AddingNewScopes.md)
* [Controllers](Controllers/readme.md)
