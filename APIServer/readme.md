# Random Stuff API Server

Repository of this API Server,  [available here](https://github.com/Jay-study-nildana/RandomStuffGenerator)

# Running Setup (during development)

* Update Auth0 server details as per your Auth0 Server Configuration
* Visual Studio 2019
* Build and Run
* Swagger will need a auth token. 
* auth token can be generated on the Auth0 dashboard. 
* OR, another, simpler option, collect it from the React JS App, developer tools, API Network Calls. 
* Note : Swagger only needs the bearer token to be copy pasted in the 'lock' symbol. Everything else is already formatted as part of the Swagger configuration.
