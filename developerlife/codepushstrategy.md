# Code Push Strategy

This entire project is to show case my skills, as a developer, and trainer. 

I have the following core system in terms of code management.

* Private Repo - for internal development, deployment with internal notes included
* Public Repo - for public showcase only. internal notes and deployment specifics like secrets and connection strings and related things removed.
* Separate repos - I am not a big fan of mono repo. I am keeping the API Server and the Client App in separate repos.
* They will have their version numbers.

Every public push, will involve the following.

* Archiving the about to be retired master code into a separate branch with the version number.
* Update the master with the latest code.
* Update Full Version History Page.
* Update VersionandChangeLog
