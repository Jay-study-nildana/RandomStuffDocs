# Roles Management

Here, you will find detailed notes about managing roles with Auth0. The process is quiet technical and complicated.

# General Steps

* First, add the permissions.
* Next, add a role and link permission to that. If role is not available, create one.
* Next, take a user and link a role to that user. It is possible to link a user to a permission directly. However, role linking is better for permission linking to a specific user is almost micro management kind of deal. Perhaps, not the best thing.
