# User Not Logged In API Endpoints

Additional notes about API Endpoints.

# Access

These endpoints are open to anyone. It's for endpoints specificallly tailored at a non-logged user who still wants to enjoy the quote products. 

This is NOT a place to put project details or other things, which have nothing to do with a customer or the product that we are serving.
