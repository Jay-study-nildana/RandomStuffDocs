# Documentation Guidelines

* Once a folder and file is committed, dont modify it. 
* That means, no moving around folders, changing file names and so on. 
* Everything is interlinked with each other with relative links.
* The Documentation folder, may be relocted, as it is.
* add new folders, files, no problem. If required, link from an existing file.
* No deleting of folders and file either. 
* Contents inside the markdown files can be changed.
