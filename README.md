# TLDR

I wanted a full stack project/service/api/app demo to showcase my developer skills and experience. This project is it.

# Tell Me More

I work as a full stack developer. Ideally, I should be able to do the following to justify this professional title of mine. 

Every company has a product that it serves to its customers. Almost all the time, this happens through applications that are managed and run over the internet. For instance, Uber, is a company that provides taxi services to communters all over the world. The product here 'is the app based cab booking'. In order to do this, it has apps that are used by its consumers - riders and drivers. these apps are powered by 'backend services' that ensure all of this works fine. Further, the 'backend services' are managed by 'internal consumers', which are called as server admins or siimply 'admins'. 

* The consumers - riders, drivers and admins - use apps. 
* The back end services power these apps. 
* Finally, these services and apps are deployed somewhere on the cloud and deployed to all the consumers. That would be the IT infrastructure. 

So, as a full stack developer, I can do all the above, and have been doing all the above for customers for the last 8 plus years. To get a little technical, I can

* Design, deploy and consult on the full IT infrastructure needed to 'deliver' the apps to all consumers - internal and external.
* Build the back end services that provide API end points which are secured with authorization and authentication
* Build the apps that the consumers use - internal and external.

# So...?

Well, this 'random stuff generator' is my product. Let's say, i am in the business of providing the service of giving my customers 'quotes'. That is my product.

In order to deliver this product to all my consumers, I have done the following

* I have built apps that my customers - internal and external - can use.
* I have built the back end services that power these apps.
* Finally, I have also designed and deployed the neccessary IT infrastructure. 

Ultimately, this project is proof that I can build all these things. So, if you are a small business owner or a startup, you can see for yourself that I can do what I claim to do. 

Perhaps, you are impressed, and you will hire me to do the same for your company's product or service. 

# Target Audience

This documentation is as comprehesive as I can humanly make it. It's primarily meant for other developers and technical audience. 

* Clients, who wish to dig deeper, and find out if I have the technical chops that I claim to have when bidding for new projects and contracts.
* These other developers could be my students who are taking classes with me and want to understand how this project was built.
* Other developers who are looking to fork the public repositories to make their own improves and raise pull requests.
