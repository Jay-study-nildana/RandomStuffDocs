# Random Stuff For Students

I have many 'for student' repositories on my github repository. I figured, this project would also benefit from a folder dedicated with similar information. 

# Success Test - After running locally or after deployment

If you are trying to run the random stuffy generator project on your computer, find the checklist below. Or, perhaps you are trying to deploy it yourself.

1. API Server on Swagger- If 'api/ProjectDetails/Hi' works, that means the server deployment is successful.
1. API Server on Swagger - If '/api/UserNotLoggedIn/GetHoldOfthem' works, that means the database is working.
1. API Server on Swagger - copy paste token from your React JS App developer tools and if '/api/User/Hi' works, that means, authentication is working.
1. React JS App - On home page, load, you get a nice quote. That means, basic app is working.
1. React JS App - Login works, that means, authentication is configured.
