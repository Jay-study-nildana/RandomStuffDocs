# Random Stuff Generator - The Idea

The idea is here is that, I am the owner of a company, that delivers quotes over the internet. Somehow, by magic, people are paying for it, also, by some magic!

I start by thinking of the consumer. I have three consumers for my company.

* Quote Reader - the final customer who likes to read a quote, as required.
* Quote Moderator - An internal customer who is responsible for managing the quotes and content
* Quote Admin - An internal customer who is responsible for all the admin tasks like user management, role management with access to every data that is available to make a better decision to build and run the business profitably.
